This book was selected by your mods out of the category of hature writing and will be read from July 15 - August 25.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

â€œI suggested Fuzz because it's a great book that makes you think about our relationship with nature and the various conflicts that can arise when we interact with it. Mary Roach does an excellent job at making all the science stuff engaging and entertaining. I think this book will be interesting to discuss as I'm sure we all have some human/animal conflict stories of our own."
