This book was selected by Sequoia branch members and will be read from August 26 - October 6.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

“Piranesi is a novel that mixes fantasy with literary fiction and is 100% my gateway drug to light fantasy. Such a new experience is always better shared, so I’m very excited to get to do that with BoB!"
