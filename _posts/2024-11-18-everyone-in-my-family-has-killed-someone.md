The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

â€œI don't read a ton of mysteries myself but I had a lot of fun with this book. It has some great twists and turns that kept me captivated, family drama and some fun meta-commentary about mystery tropes that had me chuckling along. I am excited to discuss this story and figure out "whodunit" with all of you."
