This book was selected by your Wisteria branch members and will be read from February 10 - March 23.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

â€œThis book is a fun, slightly mysterious read centering friendship and found family that fits the subtly supernatural Wisteria branch vibe. It's also the start of a series (and spinoff) that I heartily recommend!"
