This book was selected by your Magnolia branch members and will be read from March 24 - May 4.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

â€œWhile we ended up suggesting an eclectic variety of books for Magnolia's branch pick, a lot of us were feeling the historical fiction vibe for this round. I read The Night Watchman a few years ago, but still regularly think about it. It is set in the US in the 1950s and covers a piece of US history I was not aware of. The titular night watchman is based on the author's grandfather and the whole novel is filled with memorable characters and their relationships. There's so much material for discussion, from the history the novel discusses, the mysteries in the plot and the choices the characters make. I can also recommend the audiobook, read by the author."
