"Centered around a small public library with a mysteriously insightful librarian, this book weaves together the stories of a series of library patrons, exploring the many things libraries offer and the ways they create community.  It's a cozy and hopeful celebration of these things, and also shows how libraries help combat society's growing loneliness issue.  I found it quietly compelling, and it lived in my heart and mind for weeks after I finished it."
