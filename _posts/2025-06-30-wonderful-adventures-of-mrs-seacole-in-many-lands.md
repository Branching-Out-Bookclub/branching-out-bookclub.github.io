This book was selected by your volunteer team from the category BIPOC Classic and will be read from June 30 - August 10.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

"Mary Seacole was a remarkable woman who traveled the world and dedicated her life to caring for the sick and wounded despite the prejudices she faced. I have learned a bit about her but I am looking forward to reading this firsthand account of her journeys with our community"
