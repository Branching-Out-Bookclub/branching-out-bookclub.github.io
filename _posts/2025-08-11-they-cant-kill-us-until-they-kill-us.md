This book was selected by your Sequoia branch members and will be read from August 11 - September 21.

The member who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why she made this suggestion: 

"They Can't Kill Us is a book about music, but it's also so much more than that, and ultimately one of the best essay collections I've ever read. Hanif has this incredible way of taking a subject (whether it be Prince or Carly Rae Jepsen) and tying them beautifully to the personal and the political. One second he'll be telling you about Fall Out Boy and the next he'll stab you in the goddamn heart."
