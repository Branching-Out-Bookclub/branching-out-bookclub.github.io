This book was selected by your mod team and will be read from September 22 - November 2.

The mod who nominated the book, has a few words to share on why they made this suggestion: 

â€œI'm not someone who reads a lot of short story collections, because I often struggle to maintain my interest in them. I read this years ago but I still remember how hooked I was, and some stories have stuck with me to the point I still think about them regularly. I think we'll have a lot to talk about as a book club!"
